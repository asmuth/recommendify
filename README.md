recommendify
============

Incremental and distributed item-based "Collaborative Filtering" for binary ratings with ruby and redis. In a nutshell: You feed in `user -> item` interactions and it spits out similarity vectors between items ("related items").  __scroll down for a demo...__

### use cases

+ "Users that bought this product also bought...". 
+ "Users that viewed this video also viewed...". 
+ "Users that follow this person also follow...". 


usage
-----

Your data should look something like this:

```
# which items are frequently bought togehter?
[order23] product5 produt42 product17
[order42] product8 produt16 product32

# which users are frequently watched/followed together?
[user4] user9 user11 user12
[user9] user6 user8 user11
```

You can add new interaction-sets to the processor incrementally, but the similarity matrix has to be manually re-processed after new interactions were added to any of the applied processors. However, the processing happens on-line and you can keep track of the changed items so you only have to re-calculate the changed rows of the matrix.

```ruby

# Our similarity matrix, we calculate the similarity via co-concurrence 
# of items in "orders" and the co-concurrence of items in user-likes using 
# two `item x item` matrices and the jaccard/cosine similarity measure.
class MyRecommender < Recommendify::Base

  # store a maximum of fifty neighbors per item
  max_neighbors 50

  # define an input data set "order_item_s". we'll add "order_id->item_id"
  # pairs to this input and use the jaccard coefficient to retrieve a 
  # "customers that ordered item i1 also ordered item i2" statement and apply
  # the result to the item<->item similarity matrix with a weight of 5.0
  input_matrix :order_items, 
    :similarity_func => :jaccard,
    :weight => 5.0
  
  # define an input data set "like_item_s". we'll add "user_id->item_id"
  # pairs to this input and use a cosine-based similarity measure to retrieve 
  # a "users that liked item i1 also liked item i2" statement and apply the 
  # result to the item<->item similarity matrix with a weight of 1.0
  input_matrix :like_items
    :similarity_func => :cosine,
    :weight => 1.0

end

recommender = MyRecommender.new

# add `order_id->item_id` interactions to the order_item_sim input
# you can add data incrementally and call RecommendedItem.process! to update
# the similarity matrix at any time.
recommender.order_items.add_set("order1", ["item23", "item65", "item23"])
recommender.order_items.add_set("order2", ["item14", "item23"])

# add `user_id->item_id` interactions to the like_time_sim input
recommender.like_items.add_set("user1", ["item23", "item65", "item23"])
recommender.like_items.add_set("user2", ["item14", "item23"])


# Calculate all elements of the similarity matrix
recommender.process!

# ...or calculate a specific row of the similarity matrix (a specific item)
# use this to avoid re-processing the whole matrix after incremental updates
recommender.process_item!("item65")


# retrieve similar items to "item23"
recommender.for("item23") 
  => [ <Recommendify::Neighbor item_id:"item65" similarity:0.23>, (...) ]


# remove "item23" from the similarity matrix and the input matrices. you should 
# do this if your items 'expire', since it will speed up the calculation
recommender.delete_item!("item23") 
```

### how it works

Recommendify keeps an incrementally updated `item x item` matrix, the "co-concurrency matrix". This matrix stores the number of times that a combination of two items has appeared in an interaction/preferrence set. The co-concurrence counts are processed with a similarity measure to retrieve another `item x item` similarity matrix, which is used to find the N most similar items for each item. This approach was described by Miranda, Alipio et al. [1]

1. Group the input user->item pairs by user-id and store them into interaction sets
2. For each item<->item combination in the interaction set increment the respective element in the co-concurrence matrix
3. For each item<->item combination in the co-concurrence matrix calculate the item<->item similarity
3. For each item store the N most similar items in the respective output set.


### does it scale?

The maximum number of entries in the co-concurrence and similarity matrix is k(n) = (n^2)-(n/2), it grows O(n^2). However, in a real scenario it is very unlikely that all item<->item combinations appear in a interaction set and we use a sparse matrix which will only use memory for elemtens with a value > 0. The size of the similarity grows O(n). 



example
-------

These recommendations were calculated from 2,3mb "profile visit"-data (taken from www.talentsuche.de) - keep in mind that the recommender uses only visitor->visited data, it __doesn't know the gender__  of a user. 

[ ![Example Results](https://raw.github.com/paulasmuth/recommendify/master/doc/example.png) ](http://falbala.23loc.com/~paul/recommendify_out_1.html)

full snippet: http://falbala.23loc.com/~paul/recommendify_out_1.html 

Initially processing the 120.047 `visitor_id->profile_id` pairs currently takes around half an hour with the ruby-only implementation and ~130 seconds with the native/c implementation on a single core. It creates a 24.1mb hashtable in redis (with truncated user_rows a' max 100 items). In another real data set with very short user rows (purchase/payment data) it used only 3.4mb for 90k items with very good results. You can try this for yourself; the complete data and code is in `doc/example.rb` and `doc/example_data.csv`.
